Script to build OpenSSL for iPhone device and simulator platform
Tested against:
       0.9.8n: SDK 3.1.2 and 3.1.3
       0.9.8q: SDK 4.2
       1.0.0a: SDK 4.2
       1.0.0c: SDK 4.2

Place openssl-{VERSION}.tar.gz in this directory, then:

	bash Build-OpenSSL.sh

library will be ready in newly created 'dist' directory.
